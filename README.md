## üí™ Getting Started

```python
mof = MOF.from_cif('tests/test_files/HKUST-1.cif')
```

Fragment the MOF

```python
fragments = mof.fragment()
```

If you are in a Jupyter notebook you can visualize the components.

```python
fragments.linkers[0].show_molecule()
```

```python
fragments.nodes[0].show_molecule()
```

You can also search PubChem for the building blocks 

```python
fragments.linkers[0].search_pubchem()
```

To get the [RCSR code](http://rcsr.anu.edu.au/nets) run


```python
fragments.net_embedding.rcsr_code
```

## üöÄ Installation

To install the latest release run 

```bash 
pip install moffragmentor
```

To install the development version run 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kjappelbaum/moffragmentor.git
```

You need to have `openbabel` installed which you can install with `conda install -c conda-forge openbabel`. 

As a utility, you can also run `bash create_conda.sh` to create a conda environment with all dependencies.
Note that you might want to change the name of the name of the environment (defaults to `moffragmentor`).


## moffragmentor in the MOF decomposition tool landscape

While moffragmentor has some unique features, it might not be the right tool for your task. Due to some design choices (having a pymatgen representation of all fragments and the net) it is relatively slow in the current implementation (though there are obvious ways for fixing this). 

Therefore, we encourage you to also consider alternative tools: 

- [mofid](https://github.com/snurr-group/mofid)
- [mBUD](https://github.com/gdev7/mBUD)
